Version 1.1

- Built for CB 1.3.2 R2.0
- Merged together FC_PlayerTracker and FC_Mine4Cash to create FC_AemCraft. Caused lots of renaming. Check new permissions in permissions.txt.
- To upgrade, please move the files from both your ~/plugins/FC_PlayerTracker and ~/plugins/FC_Mine4Cash folders into ~/plugins/FC_AemCraft. Default folder structure is included in this package.
- Brought plugin up to much higher standard by adding things I had previously neglected for sake of speed.
- Added enable/disable messages.
- The command to use now is /aem. This is the root which brings up help for all aem commands. Several commands added under /aem to help with management in-game.

Version 1.0

- Initial Release
